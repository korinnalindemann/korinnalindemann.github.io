I am a Research Fellow at the [MZES, University of Mannheim](https://www.mzes.uni-mannheim.de/d7/en). I am also a Co-PI of the research project [Democratic Values of Immigrants from Authoritarian Regimes](https://www.mzes.uni-mannheim.de/en/projects/detail/democratic-values-among-migrants-from-authoritarian-regimes) funded by the BMFSFJ. I completed my PhD in Political Science in the Research Training Group [DYNAMICS](https://www.sowi.hu-berlin.de/en/dynamics/) and the [Hertie School](https://www.hertie-school.org/en/) in Berlin. 

My research interests focus on migration, comparative politics and political behaviour using quasi-experimental and experimental methods. Most of my research addresses a central question for contemporary democracies: What shapes attitudes and political behaviour in times of diversity? More precisely, my research seeks to 1) understand the dynamics of the political behaviour of immigrants with a particular focus on cultural transmission and 2) the political behaviour of the broader public - often, but not exclusively, through the lens of immigration. Some of my work is published or accepted at *Political Science Research and Methods* and *Electoral Studies*.
