I am a Research Fellow at the [MZES, University of Mannheim](https://www.mzes.uni-mannheim.de/d7/en). I am also a Co-PI of the research project [Democratic Values of Immigrants from Authoritarian Regimes](https://www.mzes.uni-mannheim.de/en/projects/detail/democratic-values-among-migrants-from-authoritarian-regimes) funded by the BMFSFJ. 

I completed my PhD in Political Science in the Research Training Group [DYNAMICS](https://www.sowi.hu-berlin.de/en/dynamics/) and the [Hertie School](https://www.hertie-school.org/en/) in Berlin. From April 2022 to June 2022, I was visiting the Department of Political and Social Sciences at the [EUI](https://www.eui.eu/en/home). Previously, I completed my MA in Political Science and my BA in Media and Communication Studies and Political Science at the [University of Zurich](https://www.uzh.ch/cmsssl/en.html).  

My research interests focus on migration, (comparative) political behaviour, causal inference and experimental methods. In my dissertation, which was supervised by [Mark A. Kayser](http://mark-kayser.com/), I have worked mainly on the determinants of political behaviour of immigrants, where I am particularly interested in how characteristics of the regime in the country of origin influence behaviour in the host country. Besides working on effects of socialisation processes in authoritarian regimes, I am also interested in misperceptions surrounding the topic of migration and their effects on attitudes and behaviour.
