<font size="-1">Hi, I am a PhD Candidate in Political Science at the Research Training Group [DYNAMICS](https://www.sowi.hu-berlin.de/en/dynamics/) and the [Hertie School](https://www.hertie-school.org/en/) in Berlin since September 2020. From April 2022 to June 2022, I was visiting the Department of Political and Social Sciences at the [EUI](https://www.eui.eu/en/home). Previously, I completed my MA in Political Science and my BA in Media and Communication Studies and Political Science at the [University of Zurich](https://www.uzh.ch/cmsssl/en.html). In 2019, I was also a visiting student at the [University of Warsaw](https://en.uw.edu.pl/) for one semester.  </font>

<font size="-1">My research interests focus on migration, political behaviour, representation and quantitative methods. In my dissertation, which is supervised by [Mark A. Kayser](http://mark-kayser.com/), I work on the political behaviour and representation of immigrants in the host country. I am particularly interested how characteristics of the regime in the country of origin influence behaviour in the host country.</font>
