#### Lingering Memories of the Past: The Electoral Behaviour of Immigrants Socialised in Authoritarian Regimes

*Draft available upon request*

<sub>*Abstract*: What impact does the regime type during political socialisation in the country of origin have on the political behaviour of immigrants in the host country? The political past of immigrants is often overlooked when assessing their political behaviour, although the political experiences made can differ tremendously. In this article, I build on political socialisation research and argue that immigrants socialised in left-wing authoritarian regimes will show negative sentiments towards the political left and, therefore, support parties on the political right, while the mechanism works vice versa for immigrants socialised in right-wing authoritarian
regimes. I test these expectations on the German case relying on the GSOEP and V-Dem data by applying Coarsened Exact Matching (CEM) before estimating parametric regression models. Results suggest a bias against the political left for immigrants socialised in left-wing authoritarian regimes compared to their democratic counterparts. This effect is, however, conditioned by the number of formative years spent in the origin country. Immigrants socialised in right-wing authoritarian regimes do, on the other hand, not show a consistent bias against the political right in their political behaviour compared to immigrants socialised in democratic regimes.</sub>

#### Minority policies and outgroup hostility: Evidence from face veil bans (with [Ant√≥nio Valentim](https://antoniovalentim.github.io/))

*Draft available upon request*

<sub>*Abstract*: Do voters react to policies targeting ethnic minorities? Governments in Western democracies have recently taken restrictive stances on migration and the integration of ethnic minorities. While most recent research on integration is focused on the consequences of intergroup contact, less is known about how voters react to these policies. In this study, we address this gap by studying the effect of policies targeting ethnic minorities on outgroup hostility. We argue these policies are means by which political actors define who is entitled to be a member of a polity. We test this argument by studying the effect of face veil ban in the Swiss canton of Ticino on anti-migration voting and hate crimes and find the policy increased outgroup hostility. Using panel data at the individual level, we find some support for our argument. This study has implications for how policies impact the attitudes and behaviours of voters towards minorities as well as for the cohesiveness of multicultural societies.</sub>
