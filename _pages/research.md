### Working Papers
- #### Lingering Memories of the Past: The Electoral Behaviour of Immigrants Socialised in Authoritarian Regimes
<sub>*Under review, draft available upon request*</sub>

<sub>*Abstract*: How does the political socialisation in authoritarian regimes affect the political behaviour of immigrants in democracies? The political past of immigrants is often overlooked when assessing their political behaviour, although experiences with politics can differ substantially. Building on research of political socialisation and authoritarian legacies, I argue that immigrants socialised in left-wing authoritarian regimes avoid the political left and support right of centre parties, while the mechanism works vice versa for immigrants socialised in right-wing authoritarian regimes. Using the German Socioeconomic Panel and V-Dem while applying Coarsened Exact Matching (CEM), I find a bias against the political left for immigrants socialised in left-wing authoritarian regimes compared to their democratic counterparts. Immigrants socialised in right-wing authoritarian regimes also express a bias against the political left, but only if the country has a communist past. Those from  countries with no communist past do not behave vastly differently compared to immigrant from democracies.</sub>

- #### Banning the Face Veil: Exclusionary Policies and Anti-Immigration Voting (with [Ant√≥nio Valentim](https://antoniovalentim.github.io/))
<sub>*Draft available upon request*</sub>

<sub>*Abstract*: Do voters react to policies targeting ethnic minorities? Governments in Western democracies have recently taken restrictive stances on migration and the integration of minorities. While most recent research on integration is focused on the consequences of intergroup contact, less is known about how voters react to these policies. We address this gap by studying how policies targeting ethnic minorities influence the electorate' attitudes and behaviour. We argue that policies can signal who is considered a member of a polity, and thus normalize more anti-immigration and -integration positions. We test this argument by studying the face veil ban in the Swiss canton of Ticino and find that the policy increased anti-migration and -integration voting. Survey analyses show that the ban increased negative attitudes towards Muslims, the target minority. This study has implications for how policies impact attitudes and behaviours towards minorities as well as for the cohesiveness of multicultural societies. </sub>


- #### Regimes and Redistribution Preferences in an Experimental Online Game

<sub> *Abstract*: How do highly redistributive regimes affect redistribution preferences? Evidence from literature on political socialisation and authoritarian legacies shows that in new democracies, there is evidence for a bias against the ideological spectrum connected to the former authoritarian ideology. Direct or indirect experiences that can be clearly tied to a particular political ideology can, therefore, create negative associations with this ideological spectrum among the public. Can they impact particular policy positions as well? Using experimental evidence, I assess the effect of highly redistributive regimes on support for redistribution preferences. I also test how benefiting or losing from highly redistributive regimes impact redistribution preferences with attitudinal and behavioural components. Results suggest that the effects of the experimental settings depend on the specific redistribution outcome examined. When participants are no longer benefiting from redistribution, they are less likely to favour it. On the other hand, having worse as compared to better opponents only matters if participants are actually benefitting/losing from redistribution. By conducting this experimental online game, I do not only contribute to the theoretical understanding of institutions and redistribution preferences, but also propose a combined attitudinal and behavioural approach to experimentally measure preferences.</sub>
