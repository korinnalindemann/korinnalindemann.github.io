### Working Papers
#### [Lingering Memories of the Past: The Electoral Behaviour of Immigrants Socialised in Authoritarian Regimes](https://doi.org/10.31219/osf.io/vyfcm)
<sub>*Under review*</sub>

<sub>*Abstract*: How does the political socialisation in authoritarian regimes affect the political behaviour of immigrants in democracies? The political past of immigrants is often overlooked when assessing their behaviour, although experiences with politics can differ substantially. In this paper, I argue that immigrants socialised in left-wing authoritarian regimes avoid the political left and support right of centre parties, while immigrants socialised in right-wing authoritarian regimes do not translate anti-right biases into host country politics. Using the German Socio-Economic Panel and V-Dem while applying Coarsened Exact Matching (CEM), I find a bias against the political left for immigrants socialised in left-wing authoritarian regimes compared to their democratic counterparts. Immigrants socialised in right-wing authoritarian regimes also express a bias against the political left, but only if the country has a longer communist past, otherwise no substantial differences appear. These results have important implications for how authoritarianism shapes political behaviour in a different context.</sub>

#### Banning the Face Veil: Exclusionary Policies and Anti-Immigration Voting (with [Ant√≥nio Valentim](https://antoniovalentim.github.io/))
<sub>*Draft available upon request*</sub>

<sub>*Abstract*: Do voters react to policies targeting ethnic minorities? Governments in Western democracies have recently taken restrictive stances on migration and the integration of minorities. While most recent research on integration is focused on the consequences of intergroup contact, less is known about how voters react to these policies. We address this gap by studying how policies targeting ethnic minorities influence the electorate' attitudes and behaviour. We argue that policies can signal who is considered a member of a polity, and thus normalize more anti-immigration and -integration positions. We test this argument by studying the face veil ban in the Swiss canton of Ticino and find that the policy increased anti-migration and -integration voting. Survey analyses show that the ban increased negative attitudes towards Muslims, the target minority. This study has implications for how policies impact attitudes and behaviours towards minorities as well as for the cohesiveness of multicultural societies. </sub>


#### Stigmatisation and Redistribution Preferences: Evidence from an Experimental Online Game
<sub>*Draft available upon request*</sub>

<sub> *Abstract*: Under what circumstances does stigmatisation of communism affect redistribution preferences? Evidence from the political behaviour literature suggests that socialisation in (post-) communist regimes leads to a bias against the ideology of the former regime. It remains, however, unclear whether stigmatisation can affect policies related to the brand of the authoritarian regime as well. Employing a novel behavioural experiment in Germany, I assess the effects of stigmatisation processes on support for redistribution, while considering whether someone experiences redistribution. Unlike hypothesised, stigmatising the GDR has not an overall negative effect on redistribution and does not seem to depend on whether a participant actually experiences redistribution. Exploratory analyses suggest, however, that it is of importance whether a participant is paired with better or worse opponents. While stigmatising the GDR has a negative effect among those paired with better opponents, this effect disappears when paired with worse opponents. Additional exploratory analyses reveal that treatment effects are heightened among high performers as well as younger participants. Some heterogeneity appears additionally between those who finished their education in East or West Germany. This study has not only important implications for the field of authoritarian legacies and redistribution preferences, but also provides a novel attitudinal and behavioural approach to experimentally measure preferences.</sub>
