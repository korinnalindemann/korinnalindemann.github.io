### Working Papers
- #### Lingering Memories of the Past: The Electoral Behaviour of Immigrants Socialised in Authoritarian Regimes
<sub>*Draft available upon request*</sub>

<sub>*Abstract*: What impact does the regime type during political socialisation in the country of origin have on the political behaviour of immigrants in the host country? The political past of immigrants is often overlooked when assessing their political behaviour, although the political experiences made can differ tremendously. In this article, I build on political socialisation research and argue that immigrants socialised in left-wing authoritarian regimes will show
negative sentiments towards the political left and, therefore, support parties on the political right, while the mechanism works vice versa for immigrants socialised in right-wing authoritarian regimes. I test these expectations on the German case relying on the GSOEP and V-Dem data by applying Coarsened Exact Matching (CEM) before estimating parametric regression models. Results suggest a bias against the political left for immigrants socialised in left-wing authoritarian regimes compared to their democratic counterparts. Immigrants socialised in right-wing authoritarian regimes also tend to show a bias against the political left, but only if said country has a socialist past. Those from countries with no socialist past do not show a consistent bias against the political right compared to those socialised in democratic regimes. These results help to understand how pre-migration socialisation processes under certain regimes can shape the political behaviour of immigrants in the host
country.</sub>

- #### Minority policies and outgroup hostility: Evidence from face veil bans (with [Ant√≥nio Valentim](https://antoniovalentim.github.io/))
<sub>*Draft available upon request*</sub>

<sub>*Abstract*: Do voters react to policies targeting ethnic minorities? Governments in Western democracies have recently taken restrictive stances on migration and the integration of ethnic minorities. While most recent research on integration is focused on the consequences of intergroup contact, less is known about how voters react to these policies. In this study, we address this gap by studying the effect of policies targeting ethnic minorities on outgroup hostility. We argue these policies are means by which political actors define who is entitled to be a member of a polity. We test this argument by studying the effect of face veil ban in the Swiss canton of Ticino on anti-migration voting and hate crimes and find the policy increased outgroup hostility. Using panel data at the individual level, we find some support for our argument. This study has implications for how policies impact the attitudes and behaviours of voters towards minorities as well as for the cohesiveness of multicultural societies. </sub>


- #### Redistribution Preferences in an Experimental Online Game
<sub> *Abstract*: How do highly redistributive regimes affect redistribution preferences? Evidence from literature on political socialisation and authoritarian legacies shows that in new democracies, there is evidence for a bias against the ideological spectrum connected to the former authoritarian ideology. Direct or indirect experiences that can be clearly tied to a particular political ideology can, therefore, create negative associations with this ideological spectrum among the public. Can they impact particular policy positions as well? Using experimental evidence, I assess the effect of highly redistributive regimes on support for redistribution preferences. I also test how benefiting or losing from highly redistributive regimes impact redistribution preferences with attitudinal and behavioural components. Results suggest that the effects of the experimental settings depend on the specific redistribution outcome examined. When participants are no longer benefiting from redistribution, they are less likely to favour it. On the other hand, having worse as compared to better opponents only matters if participants are actually benefitting/losing from redistribution. By conducting this experimental online game, I do not only contribute to the theoretical understanding of institutions and redistribution preferences, but also propose a combined attitudinal and behavioural approach to experimentally measure preferences.</sub
